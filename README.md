# Arduino_BLE_and_web
A bunch of experiments built on and tested on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and Google Chrome.
Each project comes with a README for extra information.

To set up an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

The following libraries need to be installed on Arduino IDE:
Arduino_HTS221 (To get temperature and humidity data)
Arduino_LSM9DS1 (To get IMU data)
Arduino_TensorFlowLite (To be able to do machine learning on the arduino)
Arduino_BLE (To be able to use BLE)

The following 3rd party modules will be used for the websites:
p5 ble js
bootstrap
